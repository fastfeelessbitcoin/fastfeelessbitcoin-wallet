FastFeelessBitcoin-Wallet is a community driven fork of the popular nano wallet [Nault](https://github.com/Nault/Nault) ðŸ’™

It's a fully client-side signing wallet for sending and receiving [FastFeelessBitcoin](https://github.com/fastfeelessbitcoin/fbtc-node/) directly in your browser at [wallet.fastfeelessbitcoin.com](https://wallet.fastfeelessbitcoin.com).

Seamless integration with any FastFeelessBitcoin compatible RPC backend/websocket and the aim to be more frequently maintained are some of the main features. Those together will greatly increase the stability, performance and uptime.
